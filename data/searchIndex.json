They live in stable groups of around twenty animals of both sexes, plus their offspring, and defend year-round territories. They sleep together in an underground den, and set off each day on a foraging trip, digging up beetles and millipedes. Over the years we have uncovered many surprising and unusual features of banded mongoose social groups which make them an ideal system to test theories about how animal societies – including human societies – evolved. Below is a list of some of our main research themes.","Banded mongooses are cooperative breeders: a breeding system in which some individuals reproduce and others, called helpers, focus on raising the offspring. Unlike other cooperative breeders however, helping in banded mongooses takes the form of ‘escorting’, where each helper forms a close bond with a single offspring which it feeds, protects, and teaches how to forage. Around four or five females in each give birth together on exactly the same day, which means that mothers can’t identify their own offspring in the communal litter. Since adults don’t know which pups are their own, they provide extra food to the smallest and weakest offspring, which has the effect of levelling out inequalities among pups and ensuring that the maximum number of young survive.","Read about escorting and birth synchrony in mongoose groups here.","Banded mongooses are one of the most intensely warlike mammals on the planet. Mongoose groups are extremely territorial, and frequently enter into violent fights with their neighbours over food and mates. These fights can be deadly: rates of death in battle in banded mongooses are comparable to those observed in humans and chimpanzees. We know that many of these fights are started by females as a way of avoiding inbreeding. Females lead their group into encounters with neighbouring groups and use the chaos of battle to mate with rival males. Because we know almost everything about the individuals in our population, from birth to death, we can use the mongooses to test more general theories about the causes and consequences of warfare in animal societies. Our current research, funded by an ERC Advanced Grant, aims to unravel what drives groups to such extreme levels of conflict, and what factors might promote peace between groups.","Read some of our research findings here.","Life history refers to how animals grow, survive and reproduce across their lifespan. Testing how different patterns of life history evolved requires studies of animals living in their natural environment, exposed to natural predators and pathogens. Because of the detail and continuity of our data, the banded mongoose system has proved to be a powerful model system to test ideas about why some individuals develop faster, or age more quickly, than others. We have studied how conditions experienced early in life can have consequences for health and fitness in adulthood; and investigate why, unusually for social mammals, banded mongoose males live substantially longer lives than females.","Read about our life history findings here, here, and here.","How does collective behaviour emerge from natural selection acting on individual agents? This is a question of great current interest in biology. Banded mongooses exhibit many remarkable examples of collective behaviour, from the extreme birth synchrony of breeding females, to the collective battles which are fought by teams of male warriors. We are currently using drones and detailed tracking methods to investigate how groups remain cohesive as they move around their environment, how they coordinate to form ‘battle lines’ during intergroup conflicts, and how they decide which animals will stay behind to babysit offspring at the den.","Read about some of our findings on collective behaviour here and here.","In most cooperatively breeding birds and mammals, reproduction is monopolised by one or two dominant female breeders. In banded mongooses, however, all females in the group older than one year can, and do, reproduce. For years we have tried to understand why reproduction is shared among females in this system. Our research has revealed that the answer lies in the extreme birth synchrony observed in this system, where all pregnant females usually synchronise their births to the exact same morning. By giving birth in perfect synchrony, females mix up the usual cues to maternity, removing the ability of dominant females to identify and kill the offspring of rival females. Synchronous birth is also the trick by which subordinate females escape the reproductive control of dominants.","Read more about this remarkable and unique birth system here and here.","One of the downsides of living in tight knit groups, in which immigration is almost non-existent, is the risk of inbreeding. Female banded mongooses avoid inbreeding to some extent by mating with males from other groups. Over time, however, group members become genetically more similar to each other, leading to violent internal conflicts and the forced expulsion of groups of females, and sometimes groups of males too. These genetic drivers of conflict and dispersal have been uncovered by painstaking genetic analyses, revealing in exceptional detail how genetic factors shape the dynamics of the population.","Read more about our work on inbreeding and population structure here and here.","We can use the banded mongoose escort system as a natural cross-fostering experiment to disentangle genetic and cultural influences on development. We have shown experimentally that pups learn foraging techniques from their escorts via imitation. Using stable isotopes and genetic analyses, we have also demonstrated that pups inherit their lifelong foraging niche from their escort, not their genetic parents. Recently, we have uncovered evidence that escort cognitive skills affect the survival chances of the offspring in their care (but not in the way we expected!).","Read about these studies here and here.","Banded mongooses are extremely vocal animals. While moving around in the bush they emit a constant stream of grunts and growls, occasional squeals and, when a predator is around, loud shrieks. We have studied the acoustic properties of these calls using innovative experiments and playbacks. Our studies have revealed that banded mongoose ‘contact calls’ – short, soft grunts – convey information about who they are and what they are doing. Effectively, their calls convey information such as ‘Amy, digging’,  ‘Bob, walking’, and so on.","Read more about this remarkable aspect of their vocalisations (known as segmental concatenation) here.","Mongoose videos by Feargus Cooney, Leela Channer.","2025 BMPR.

Rood studied the Mweya mongooses for five years from the early 1970s, but had to abandon his research in 1976 as Uganda descended into chaos under Idi Amin. In the early 1990s, Daniela De Luca, an Italian graduate student, returned to Mweya to follow up on Rood’s observations. The Banded Mongoose Research Project was founded a few years later in 1995, by Michael Cant from the University of Cambridge. Since then, the project has grown into a world-leading study of social mammals, generating over 130 peer-reviewed scientific papers and helping to train a new generation of animal behaviour researchers. The Banded Mongoose Project supports a population of over 200 banded mongooses living in nine social groups.","We are funded by grants from the European Research Council, the Natural Environment Research Council of the UK, and The German Research Foundation (DFG). It takes a lot of work to keep a project going for 30 years, and part of the reason why we have been successful at winning funding is that banded mongooses challenge established wisdom about how and why animal societies evolve. We are rewarded by being able to follow individuals across their entire lives and over multiple generations, finding answers to important questions. What are the consequences of getting a good start in life? Why are some individuals more cooperative than others, or more aggressive? How do conflicts within family arise and how are they resolved? Why do some animals go to war? These are questions that studies of wild animals can answer in a way that laboratory research cannot.","The Banded Mongoose Project is based on and around Mweya Peninsula, in Queen Elizabeth National Park (QENP), western Uganda. QENP is managed by the Uganda Wildlife Authority and protects a variety of different habitats, including open savannah, vast crater lakes, swamps and extensive areas of forest. The park is home to a diverse array of fauna, including lions, leopards, elephants, buffalo, hippos, chimpanzees and more than 600 bird species.","Mweya Peninsula is dominated by sicklebush (Dichrostachys cinerea) and thickets of Euphorbia candelabrum, Capparis tormentosa and Azima tetracantha, with patches of grassland (mainly Sporobulus pyrimidalis, Chloris orientalis and Chloris gayana). Waterbuck, buffalo and warthogs are common, and elephants are regular visitors. Crocodiles are regularly observed by the lake shore and monitor lizards and snakes are common.","Mweya is the headquarters of Queen Elizabeth National Park and the site of Mweya Safari Lodge, a busy tourist hotel. There are no fences in the park and wild animals (including mongooses) roam freely in Mweya village. As Mweya is close to the equator, there is little annual fluctuation in day length or temperature. Some rain falls in most months, although rainfall peaks in April-May and September-November.","Distribution of shaded mongoose (shaded brown).

Banded mongooses are the rougher, tougher cousins of the meerkat, and have fascinating social lives. On these pages you will find out more about what makes banded mongooses so special, why scientists are so interested in them, and what the can tell us about other social animals, including ourselves!","My research aims to understand patterns of behaviour and life history in social animals, particularly animals that exhibit cooperative behaviour, such as the banded mongoose. Building on some pioneering research in the 70s and early 90s, I started the current phase of the Banded Mongoose Research Project in 1995 for my PhD research, with the help of Francis Mwanguhya who is now the Field Manager. The project has grown in size and complexity over the years, not least because banded mongooses have turned out to be ideal for testing theories about cooperation and conflict, early life influences on health and behaviour, and how the features of a society shape an animal’s life history. They are also unusual in many respects – males live longer than females, females synchronise birth to the same day, and males form one-to-one relationships with pups that are not their own, to name just three. Our research on how and why these patterns occur has contributed to a better understanding of the lives and behaviour of animals that live in families and groups.","I am the Banded Mongoose Research Project Field Manager and have been working with the mongooses together with Mike since 1996. I am responsible for the day to day management and organisation of the field work. I have enjoyed seeing the project grow and develop over the years, and still enjoy seeing the mongooses every day. I particularly enjoy seeing new packs form in our population as I like the challenge of habituating wild individuals and comparing the behaviour of new packs with established ones. For this reason, I have a soft spot for Pack 19, a new pack on the peninsula, and am keen to get to know them as they become more habituated. I like reading novels and my favourite book is Half of a Yellow Sun by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. I am also a keen sportsman and Manchester United fan. I have a wife, Edna, and four children: Sylvia, Evelyn, Shivan and Kelvin.","I’m a Professor in the Department of Biology at the University of York. My interests centre on causal inference, animal sociality, animal life history. I’m fascinated by animal societies because they offer profound insights into the evolution of cooperation, communication, and social complexity. Studying how animals organize, interact, and solve problems helps us understand not only their worlds but also fundamental principles that shape all social life. I'm interested in causal inference because the most important thing to me in science is getting it right! In my spare time, I like to write and record songs, hit the gym, and spend time with my son.","I’m a Lecturer in Ecology and Evolution, at the Organismal and Evolutionary biology research Programme at University of Helsinki. My main research focus is on how early life environment and stress connect to behaviour and evolution of life history traits in social mammals, including humans. I am also a researcher in the Finnish birth cohort FinnBrain, at the University of Turku, where I investigate the mediating role of cellular ageing in linking maternal welfare and early life stress exposure to child developmental outcomes. Understanding effects of stress exposure and its interactions with the social environment is important, because it has wide implications on health and wellbeing across species, including our own. In my spare time, I enjoy the magic of bringing music alive, through singing at the Helsinki Academic Choral Society.","I am a behavioural ecologist with broad interests in conservation, ecology and animal behaviour. My research investigates how conflict arises and is resolved in cooperative species, and how individual level behaviour can have group and population level effects. I study within- and between-group conflict and population dynamics in banded mongooses: specifically, I am interested in why individuals are evicted from their group and what happens to them after they leave. I also study aggressive interactions between neighbouring groups in the population to understand what drives groups to engage in costly fights with one another. I aim to explain how these conflicts can affect the behaviour and spatial organisation of groups, and the dynamics of the wider population.","I am an Associate Professor in Zoology at Swansea University. My research uses a multidisciplinary approach to investigate how animal societies evolve, combining observational data with genetic, ecological and biochemical data. In particular, my work has focused on four interconnecting  themes 1) exploring the evolution of cooperation 2) understanding the importance of inbreeding and inbreeding avoidance in cooperative species 3) investigating the role of scent communication in cooperation and breeding decisions, and 4) understanding the genetic structure of animal societies. Whilst I am fascinated by evolution and behaviour, continuing declines in biodiversity have prompted me to increasingly focus my research on conservation, with recent projects investigating the impact of climate change, mitigating human-wildlife conflict and using conservation genetics to improve species reintroductions.","My research tackles important and timely questions at the interface of evolutionary, ecological and conservation genetics.  I am particularly interested in the factors that shape genetic diversity over space and time, as well as in the impacts of genetic variation on individual fitness and population viability.  My research is becoming increasingly interdisciplinary, combining genetics and genomics approaches with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, stable isotope analysis, endocrinological and immunological profiling, movement analysis, in situ mesocosms, reciprocal transplant experiments and thermal challenge experiments.","I am an Assistant Professor in the Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology Department at Brown University in Providence, RI, USA. My research aims to understand how animals gather and use information. I joined the Banded Mongoose Research Project because I was interested in understanding how animal groups—comprised of individuals with diverse abilities and motivations—come together during contests to make collective decisions. While I still work with the BMRP, in my current position I am re-establishing a focus on my PhD system of fighting mantis shrimp-- crustaceans that fight by exchanging bullet-like blows on each other's armored tailplates. I hope to use \"extreme\" examples—from warring mongooses to high-force shrimp strikes—to gain novel insights into how animals navigate their daily lives. Outside of science, I love being a father to my son (with a second arriving soon!) and exploring the Northeast of the US!","I’m a Professor of Evolution and Animal Behaviour in the Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge. My research involves the use of game theory and evolutionary simulation modelling to predict how animals behave under different social and ecological conditions. I am particularly interested in social evolution and the evolution of patterns of cooperation and conflict. Some of my theoretical work is inspired by the banded mongoose system, including my work on the evolution of intergroup conflict, the formation and maintenance of group identity and the cognitive mechanisms underpinning complex cooperation.","I’m creating an ATLAS system to monitor banded mongoose movement, which will be used to understand attraction-avoidance dynamics between mongoose groups. I’m originally from Upstate New York, where I worked on birds, amphibians, and carnivores. I then moved to the remote Soutpansberg mountainous to work on wild primates and leopards in rare Afromontane mist-belt forests. I love the physical challenge of scaling cliffs and crawling through wet forests, and was lucky enough to receive a Presidential Fellowship from The State University of New York to continue my work on primate-predator interactions for my PhD. After returning to the US, I worked on the ecosystem impacts of mountain lions. In 2021, I moved to Germany to work as a postdoc at The Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior, before moving to the UK in 2024. In my free time, I love lone hiking in the backcountry, lifting weights, and bad weather.","I’m a final year PhD student at Swansea University investigating inheritance routes, scent gland histology and glandular microbiomes in banded mongooses, under the supervision of Dr Hazel Nichols. My main research interests lie in understanding the evolution of social behaviour and exploring the genetic and cultural routes in which information can be inherited across generations. While I have always been curious about the relative contributions of nature and nurture in shaping who we are, it was researching bumblebees during my undergraduate research project at the University of Stirling that really ignited my interest in social behaviour. I was introduced to the banded mongooses during my master’s degree at the University of Exeter and have continued pursuing my research interests using this system during my PhD. Outside of my research, I’m at my happiest turning my love of wildlife into cross-stitch, embroidery or crochet and I attend local art classes where I’ve recently learnt how to paint in watercolour.","I am a PhD student at the University of Helsinki. Joining the Banded Mongoose Research Project and studying behaviour in mongooses has been my dream ever since I first read the article about imitation and traditions (Müller & Cant, 2010). My main interest is behavioural ecology, especially consistent individual behavioural differences (animal personality) and social behaviour. In my PhD, I study physiological correlates of variation in personality traits in the banded mongoose. Identifying connections between personality and physiological traits would help us to understand the underlying mechanisms of personality which may offer new tools for e.g., conservation. In my free time, I play football, knit and sew clothes, take pictures of nature, and learn African languages (e.g., Rutooro and Luganda)!","I'm Zoe, joining the Banded Mongoose Project as a PhD student at the University of Exeter, Penryn, in September 2025. My research within the INTERGROUP project will explore how conflict evolves in cooperative systems, specifically focusing on the interplay between group cohesion and individual roles in banded mongooses. Previously, I studied social ontogeny and foraging development in meerkats, which sparked my fascination with behavioural observation and social dynamics. Animal behaviour has become my passion because of the insights and questions that emerge from careful, patient observation of natural systems. Beyond research, I'm passionate about outreach and education, having worked in rewarding roles at animal sanctuaries and nature reserves. To decompress, I can often be found enjoying a good sunset, tap dancing, reading, or crocheting.","My PhD at Oxford Brookes University focuses on wild sleep ecology. I’m investigating how the social relationships of banded mongooses influence their group sleep, including who sleeps with whom, individual sleep cycles, den selection, and the impact of humans and changing climates on their sleeping behaviours. To do this, we’re using a variety of miniaturized, animal-mounted technologies to help us see where we quite literally cannot, including proximity loggers, accelerometers, and local environmental monitoring devices. Previously, I’ve worked across Africa with a range of species, from the southern white rhino to the spotted hyena, and I’m primarily interested in non-invasive methods to support human-wildlife coexistence. I also love wildlife photography and documenting conservation stories with my camera. In my free time, you’ll mostly find me walking my dogs, editing photos, or reading fantasy novels.","My research is on the cleaning symbiosis between banded mongooses and common warthogs, a rare mammal-mammal mutualism which is restricted to certain mongoose groups. We have little detailed understanding of the behaviours that are used to coordinate and sustain interspecific cooperation among animals; my focus is on how individual differences affect cleaning engagement, the role of social learning, interspecific communication between the two parties, and geographic variation in the behaviour. I love working at our field site and conducting personality trials, and find these questions super interesting as they can help us understand why animals behave the way they do, and how a changing environment may affect them. Besides research, I work as a photographer and in communications, and in my free time I love reading a long book or sea-swimming.","Mongoose videos by Feargus Cooney, Leela Channer.","2025 BMPR.
