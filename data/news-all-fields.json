    "body": "We were recently awarded a NERC Pushing the Frontiers Grant worth £1.25M to study the evolution and maintenance of group identity in animal societies, using banded mongooses as a model system. The project will develop and test new theory to explain how and why groups evolve distinct phenotypes in social organisms, from insects to humans.",
