description: "I am also a researcher in the Finnish birth cohort Finn Brain, at the University of Turku, where I investigate the mediating role of cellular ageing in linking maternal welfare and early life stress exposure to child developmental outcomes. Understanding effects of stress exposure and its interactions with the social environment is important, because it has wide implications on health and wellbeing across species, including our own. In my spare time, I enjoy the magic of bringing music alive, through singing at the Helsinki Academic Choral Society"
