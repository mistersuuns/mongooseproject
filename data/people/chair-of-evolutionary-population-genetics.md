description: "I am an Associate Professor in Zoology at Swansea University. My research uses a multidisciplinary approach to investigate how animal societies evolve, combining observational data with genetic, ecological and biochemical data. In particular, my work has focused on four interconnecting themes 1) exploring the evolution of cooperation 2) understanding the importance of inbreeding and inbreeding avoidance in cooperative species 3) investigating the role of scent communication in cooperation and breeding decisions, and 4) understanding the genetic structure of animal societies. Whilst I am fascinated by evolution and behaviour, continuing declines in biodiversity have prompted me to increasingly focus my research on conservation, with recent projects investigating the impact of climate change, mitigating human-wildlife conflict and using conservation genetics to improve species reintroductions. HoffmanChair of Evolutionary Population Genetics 512w, 812wMy research tackles important and timely questions at the interface of evolutionary, ecological and conservation genetics. I am particularly interested in the factors that shape genetic diversity over space and time, as well as in the impacts of genetic variation on individual fitness and population viability. My research is becoming increasingly interdisciplinary, combining genetics and genomics approaches"
