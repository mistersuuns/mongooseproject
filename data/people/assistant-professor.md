position: "Assistant Professor"
description: "I am particularly interested in the factors that shape genetic diversity over space and time, as well as in the impacts of genetic variation on individual fitness and population viability. My research is becoming increasingly interdisciplinary, combining genetics and genomics approaches with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, stable isotope analysis, and immunological profiling, movement analysis, in situ mesocosms, reciprocal transplant experiments and thermal challenge experiments. Professor in the Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology Department at Brown University in Providence, RI, USA. My research aims to understand how animals gather and use information. I joined the Banded Mongoose Research Project because I was interested in understanding how animal groups—comprised of individuals with diverse abilities and motivations—come together during contests to make collective decisions. While I still work with the BMRP, in my current position I am re-establishing a focus on my PhD system of fighting mantis crustaceans that fight by exchanging bullet-like blows on each other's armored tailplates. I hope to use examples—from warring mongooses to high-force shrimp strikes—to gain novel insights into how animals navigate their daily lives. Outside of science, I love being a father to my son (with a second arriving soon!) and exploring the Northeast of the US!"
