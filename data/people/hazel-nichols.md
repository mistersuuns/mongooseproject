description: "I am behavioural ecologist with broad interests in conservation, ecology and animal behaviour. My research investigates how conflict arises and is resolved in cooperative species, and how individual level behaviour can have group and population level effects. I study within- and between-group conflict and population dynamics in banded mongooses: specifically, I am interested in why individuals are evicted from their group and what happens to them after they leave. I also study aggressive interactions between neighbouring groups population to understand what drives groups to engage in costly fights with one another. I aim to explain how these conflicts can affect the behaviour and spatial organisation of groups, and the dynamics of the wider population. Nichols Zoology at Swansea University. My research uses a approach to investigate how animal societies evolve, combining observational data with genetic, ecological and biochemical data. In particular, my work has focused on four themes 1) exploring the evolution of cooperation 2) the importance of inbreeding and inbreeding avoidance in cooperative species 3) the role of scent communication in cooperation and breeding decisions, and 4) the genetic structure of animal societies.
