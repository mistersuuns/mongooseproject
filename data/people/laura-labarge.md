description: "I am an Assistant Professor in the Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology Department at Brown University in Providence, RI, USA. My research aims to understand how animals gather and use information. I joined the Banded Mongoose Research Project because I was interested in understanding how animal groups—comprised of individuals with diverse abilities and motivations—come together during contests to make collective decisions. While I still work with the BMRP, in my current position I am re-establishing a focus on my PhD system of fighting mantis shrimp-- crustaceans that fight by exchanging bullet-like blows on each other's armored tailplates. I hope to use \ examples—from warring mongooses to high-force shrimp strikes—to gain novel insights into how animals navigate their daily lives.
