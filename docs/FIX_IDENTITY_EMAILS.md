# Fix Netlify Identity Emails - Actionable Steps

## Current Status
✅ API endpoint: `https://mistersuuns.space/.netlify/identity` (correct)
✅ Invitation subject: Uses custom domain
❌ Other email templates: Still show netlify.app domain
❌ Email body: Not editable (Netlify limitation)
❌ Spam: Using default no-reply@netlify.com

## Step 1: Update Other Email Template Subjects

Update these to use your custom domain:

### Confirmation template
1. Click **Configure** on "Confirmation template"
2. **Subject**: Change to:
```
Verify your email for mistersuuns.space
```

### Recovery template
1. Click **Configure** on "Recovery template"  
2. **Subject**: Change to:
```
Reset your password for mistersuuns.space
```

### Email change template
1. Click **Configure** on "Email change template"
2. **Subject**: Change to:
```
Verify your new sign-in email for mistersuuns.space
```

## Step 2: Set Up Custom SMTP (Fixes Spam + Domain)

This is the most important fix:

1. **Identity → Emails → Outgoing email address → Configure**

2. Choose an email service:
   - **SendGrid** (free tier: 100 emails/day)
   - **Mailgun** (free tier: 5,000 emails/month)
   - **AWS SES** (very cheap)
   - **Your domain's email provider** (if you have one)

3. Enter SMTP settings:
   - **SMTP server host**: (from your email provider)
   - **SMTP server port**: Usually 587 (TLS) or 465 (SSL)
   - **Server login username**: Your SMTP username
   - **Server login password**: Your SMTP password
   - **Sender email address**: `noreply@mistersuuns.space` (or your domain email)

4. **Save**

This will:
- ✅ Fix spam issues (emails from your domain)
- ✅ Use your custom domain in sender address
- ✅ Improve deliverability

## Step 3: The Empty Email Body Issue

**The email body is NOT editable in Netlify Identity.** This is a Netlify limitation.

**If emails are arriving with no body content:**

1. **Test the invite again** after setting up SMTP - sometimes the default template works but gets filtered
2. **Check spam folder** - the email might be there but stripped by filters
3. **Contact Netlify support** with:
   - "Identity invitation emails are arriving with no body content, only subject line"
   - "The email body template is not editable in the UI"
   - "Is there a way to customize the invitation email body?"

## Step 4: About the Invitation Link

The "Path to template" field (`/admin/`) tells Netlify where the Identity widget is located, but the actual invitation link in the email is generated by Netlify and goes to the root domain with the token in the hash.

**The link will be something like:**
`https://mistersuuns.space/#invite_token=ABC123`

**To make it go to `/admin/` instead:**
- This requires Netlify support (the template system doesn't support customizing the link path)
- Or handle redirect in code (but you said no workarounds)

## Summary

**Do this now:**
1. ✅ Update Confirmation, Recovery, Email change template subjects
2. ✅ Set up custom SMTP (fixes spam + uses your domain)
3. ✅ Test invite again
4. ✅ Contact Netlify support if email body is still empty

**The email body limitation is a Netlify Identity constraint - it's deprecated and has limited customization options.**
